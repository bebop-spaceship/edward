File descriptors are fundamental to the Linux operating system, they are numerical identifiers associated with files opened by a process.

File descriptor 0 is associated with standard input (stdin), where programs typically read data.
File descriptor 1 is associated with standard output (stdout), where programs typically write data intended for the user.
File descriptor 2 is associated with standard error output (stderr), where programs typically write error messages or diagnostics.

Converts the first command-line argument (argv[1]) to an integer using atoi and subtracts 0x1234 (4660 in decimal) from it, assigning the result to fd.
